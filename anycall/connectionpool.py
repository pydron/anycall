    * `on_receive` invoked when we receive data from a connection.
    * `create_client_endpoint` invoked when we need to open a new
      connection. This has to return a IStreamClientEndpoint such as
      a TCP4ClientEndpoint.
      
    In addition a IStreamServerEndpoint can be passed to `__init__`.
    If so, we'll listen for incomming connections and add them to
    the pool.
